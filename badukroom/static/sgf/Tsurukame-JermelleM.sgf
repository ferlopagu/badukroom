lofuchi [2k\]: yes
Taro [-\]: there is a huge difference between 3D AGA and 6D EGF
Leothelion [2d\]: indeed
lofuchi [2k\]: oic
odnihs [-\]: they're at least 4 stones apart

liquid [-\]: different thing
awesome [3k\]: ok, I see
liquid [-\]: but its only my opinion so
awesome [3k\]: it's to demonstrate that an attack will not kill
sinojos [8k?\]: too much focus on kil is not good lesson either
Leothelion [2d\]: it's not like b could gain so much profit from attacking anyway... ^_^
