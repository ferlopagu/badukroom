Lilltiger [-\]: so from this moyo you are above the line so itäs fine
frozensoul [-\]: actually
frozensoul [-\]: hes on the line
frozensoul [-\]: and condering that the g line is strong for white p9 feels too close
Lilltiger [-\]: indeed
frozensoul [-\]: i think
Lilltiger [-\]: as w has the other moyo as well
frozensoul [-\]: there is no weakness on the right side except p15
frozensoul [-\]: and the left weakness is around g14
frozensoul [-\]: so black should coordinate his reductions from those areas
frozensoul [-\]: not the right side directly
Nachtmahr [3d\]: yes k11 maybe
Kretzsche [4k?\]: are you saying b should play tengen?
Lilltiger [-\]: the easies way is to just appratch both
Lilltiger [-\]: somewhere around this area indeed
frozensoul [-\]: no im saying black should use forcing moves
Kretzsche [4k?\]: (he just said k11 to deny tengen :P)
frozensoul [-\]: around p15 and g14
frozensoul [-\]: then sabaki
frozensoul [-\]: lol
Lilltiger [-\]: so remember to check all moyo intersections before you go for reduction
